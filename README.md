# Flutter app for data-warehouse project

Data is crawled from [Topcv](https://www.topcv.vn/viec-lam)

UI is cloned from [Best-Flutter-UI-Templates](https://github.com/mitesh77/Best-Flutter-UI-Templates)



## Installation 
Run `Pub get`

**Notice**: The main android project is under `./data_warehouse_app`, so open this folder on Android studio. 

If you want to open the whole project (wemapgl + data_warehouse_app), remember to change your Dart entry point (`Run -> Dart entrypoint`) to `.\data_warehouse_app\data_warehouse_app\lib\main.dart` (not `data_warehouse_app\lib\main.dart`)
